the point of this little app is to recreate a particular game mechanic found in the game "Papers, Please"<br>

There is a stack of papers on your desk<br>
When you click on any one piece of papers, visually it moves to the top of the stack<br>
While the mouse button is held down, you can move the paper on the desk.<br>
When the mouse button is let go, the paper stays where it is "dropped" <br>
There is a maximum of 5-6 papers in the stack at any one time. (this little test program is expandable and works well in the thousands of papers)<br> 
There is not much room on the desk, so the papers are always at least partially overlapping<br>
